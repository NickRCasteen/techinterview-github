This repository contains all the relevant files. This project is hosted on github, running off my blog which was scaffolded using Yeoman with the simple static blog generator by github user matthewbdaly (https://github.com/matthewbdaly).

Parts of the visual styling was cannibalized from my capstone project as well as the blog itself. Juggling this that and the other these last two weeks, I'm happy with the result. Since it's HTML, it works on mobile, though the css makes it a bit wonky. Rotating the screen makes it better, however.
